# Electric Load Profiles of 38 Households: Multi-Year, Multi-Resolution Data

## Description

This dataset contains electric load measurements from 38 households in a small village in Lower Saxony, Germany. The data includes voltage, active power, and reactive power, with separate recordings for total household load, individual heat pumps, and the local power transformer. Measurements are provided at various temporal resolutions (10 seconds, 1 minute, 15 minutes, and 60 minutes) and spatial aggregations to facilitate different types of analyses. The dataset covers multiple years and is suitable for research on residential energy consumption, heat pump usage, and local grid behavior.
