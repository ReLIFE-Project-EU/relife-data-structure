# Consumption Profiles of Digital Electricity Meters: 15-Minute Values for a Full Year

## Description

This dataset contains 15-minute interval consumption and injection data from 2,400 anonymized digital electricity meters in the Flemish region. The meters are all residential and have complete data coverage for an entire year. The sample is divided into eight categories of 300 meters each, based on the presence of solar panels, heat pumps, and home-charging electric vehicles. Only meters that remained in the residential contract category and were active throughout the year are included. The dataset distinguishes between meters with and without solar panel injection, as well as combinations with heat pumps and electric vehicles.
