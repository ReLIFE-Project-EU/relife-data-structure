# Three Years of Hourly Data from 3021 Smart Heat Meters in Danish Residential Buildings

## Description

This dataset provides three years of hourly heat consumption data from 3021 smart heat meters installed in Danish residential buildings. The data has been cleaned, interpolated for equidistant time steps, and missing values have been imputed using a weighted moving average and scaling algorithm to maintain the cumulative trend. In addition to the processed data, anonymised raw data from 3127 smart heat meters are included to support transparency and reproducibility. Contextual information such as construction year, building type, and, where available, energy label is provided for all buildings in the raw dataset. Each building can be linked across datasets via a unique meter ID.
