# SmartMeter Energy Consumption Data in London Households

## Description

This dataset contains half-hourly energy consumption readings from 5,567 London households collected during the UK Power Networks-led Low Carbon London project, spanning November 2011 to February 2014. The sample is balanced to represent the Greater London population. Each record includes energy consumption in kWh, a unique household identifier, and timestamp information. The full dataset consists of approximately 167 million rows and is provided as a CSV file (~10GB unzipped).

Within the dataset, a subgroup of around 1,100 households participated in a Dynamic Time of Use (dToU) tariff trial throughout 2013. These participants received day-ahead price signals—High (67.20p/kWh), Low (3.99p/kWh), or Normal (11.76p/kWh)—communicated via Smart Meter In Home Display or text message. The schedule of price signals, including applicable dates and times, is included in the dataset. The remaining households (~4,500) were on a flat rate tariff of 14.228p/kWh.
